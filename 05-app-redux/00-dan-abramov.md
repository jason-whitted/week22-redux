# Dan Abramov

React was released in 2013 and quickly gained popularity. It was common to distribute state throughout entire applications. Managing this state was a nightmare.

Facebook tried to address this issue with their solution, Flux, which was a global state store.

In July 2015, Dan Abramov gave a talk at the React Europe conference ([Live React: Hot Reloading with Time Travel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs)). At the time Dan was an unknown, Russian, college dropout.

By November 2015 Dan Abramov was working for Facebook.

In 2017 Dan Abramov released `create-react-app`.

In 2018 Dan Abramov gave another talk at React Conf about hooks ([React Today and Tomorrow and 90% Cleaner React With Hooks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpw9EHDh2bM)).
